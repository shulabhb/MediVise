### Analysis: Chat Tone, Prompt Plumbing, Privacy, and CORS

Backend

- app/llm_prompts.py
  - Contains summarization and QA prompt constants (`SUMMARY_*`, `QA_SYSTEM`, `QA_USER_TEMPLATE`, risk/medication prompts).
  - Added `FRIENDLY_TONE_SYSTEM` and `CHAT_WITH_CONTEXT_TEMPLATE` constants for consistent conversational style and context plumbing.

- app/llm_service.py
  - Provides `MedicalLLMService` with Ollama integration; exposes `rag_answer` using `QA_SYSTEM` and `QA_USER_TEMPLATE` (markdown-friendly answers, explicit citation format).
  - Summarization uses de-identification (`deidentify_phi`) and map-reduce; JSON repair logic present.
  - Future improvement: wire `FRIENDLY_TONE_SYSTEM`/`CHAT_WITH_CONTEXT_TEMPLATE` into RAG prompts to standardize tone and light structure, and encourage subtle citations like “(doc:13 p2)”.

- app/main.py
  - CORS explicitly allows localhost and 127.0.0.1 across multiple ports.
  - Authentication required via `Depends(get_current_user)` for chat, document, and memory routes.
  - Chat endpoints currently use an in-memory per-user store `CONVERSATIONS[uid]` → conversations/messages (scoped by Firebase UID).
  - Conversational endpoints build a system prompt in-code; we prepended a friendly tone block. Further refactor could centralize to `llm_prompts.py`.
  - Document endpoints filter by `user_id == uid` ensuring per-user isolation.

- app/auth.py
  - Validates Firebase bearer token with Admin SDK; returns decoded token with `uid` used for scoping.

- app/models.py and app/database.py
  - SQLAlchemy models include `Conversation.user_id` and `Document.user_id` (Firebase UID) for user isolation. In-memory chat path is used by current chat endpoints; DB-backed chat is present but not wired in those routes.

Frontend

- src/pages/Chat.tsx
  - Renders markdown via `ReactMarkdown` with GFM; line breaks and lists render cleanly.
  - Message send path calls backend `/chat/...` endpoints; attachment pill shown before send; timestamps rendered.
  - UI updated for softer palette, bubbles, and friendly formatting.

Gaps / Next Steps

- Prompt plumbing: Now that `FRIENDLY_TONE_SYSTEM` and `CHAT_WITH_CONTEXT_TEMPLATE` exist, update `llm_service.rag_answer` and conversational handlers to use them consistently (while preserving safety guidance and factual grounding). Consider subtly formatting citations like “(doc:13 p2)”.
- Privacy: Current chat path does not explicitly suppress PHI echoing in free-form chat; consider a light heuristic/redaction pass for assistant outputs unless PHI appears in user input.
- Persistence: In-memory chat is user-scoped but ephemeral; decide on DB persistence for conversations/messages leveraging existing models.
